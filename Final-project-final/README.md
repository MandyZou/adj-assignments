An application for the newsroom to check changes of bill status that happened in today. 

First, someone should run the “APIweb_scrape.py” file. They should fill in today’s date and their own email address and the newsroom email address. Both email addresses should be gmail account.

Then, after finishing the scraping, run the “APIweb_email.py” file. The python will send out an email with the csv file to the newsroom email (or any other email they typed in).
